# Interactive-Gantt-Chart-Visualizer-for-CPU-scheduling-algorithms
This full-stack web simulator visualizes core CPU scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, SRTF, RR). It uses a Python/Flask backend for precise, clock-cycle simulation and a React/D3.js frontend to display dynamic Gantt Charts and calculate key metrics like AWT and ATT, demonstrating both OS knowledge and professional web dev skills.
